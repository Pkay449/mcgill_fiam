\subsection*{16.A.2 Inverse Variance Allocation}

Stage 3 (see Section 16.4.3) splits a weight in inverse proportion to the subsetâ€™s variance. We now prove that such allocation is optimal when the covariance matrix is diagonal. Consider the standard quadratic optimization problem of size $N$,

\[
\min_{\omega} \omega' V \omega
\]
\[
\text{s.t.} \ \omega' a = 1_I
\]

with solution $\omega = \frac{V^{-1} a}{a' V^{-1} a}$. For the characteristic vector $a = 1_N$, the solution is the minimum variance portfolio. If $V$ is diagonal, $\omega_n = \frac{V^{-1}_{n,n}}{\sum_{i=1}^{N} V^{-1}_{i,i}}$. In the particular case of $N = 2$, 

\[
\omega_1 = \frac{1}{V_{1,1}} \left( \frac{1}{V_{1,1}} + \frac{1}{V_{2,2}} \right)^{-1} = 1 - \frac{V_{1,1}}{V_{1,1} + V_{2,2}},
\]

which is how stage 3 splits a weight between two bisections of a subset.
