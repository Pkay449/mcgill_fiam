When applying the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test using `adfuller`, the options `maxlag=1`, `regression='c'`, and `autolag=None` are important as they influence the test's sensitivity and interpretation. Here’s when and why you might apply or avoid each option:

### 1. **`maxlag`**:
   - **Purpose**: Specifies the maximum number of lags of the differenced series to include in the test regression. The lags account for serial correlation in the data.
   - **`maxlag=1`**: Use this when you believe that the series has minimal autocorrelation or when the data is of high frequency and there’s little need for higher-order lag correction. It's also useful when you want a simple, low-lag model.
   - **When to use higher `maxlag`**: If you expect substantial autocorrelation in your series, consider increasing `maxlag`. This is particularly common in financial or economic time series where past values significantly influence current values.
   - **When to avoid**: Setting `maxlag=1` might miss capturing serial correlation if your data has a longer memory (e.g., monthly data might need more lags). A `maxlag` that’s too high may overfit, increasing standard errors unnecessarily.

### 2. **`regression`**:
   - **Purpose**: Determines the type of deterministic regressors included in the test regression. Options are:
     - `'c'`: Constant only (default).
     - `'ct'`: Constant and trend.
     - `'ctt'`: Constant, linear, and quadratic trend.
     - `'nc'`: No constant, no trend.
   - **`regression='c'`**: Use this when you believe the series has a non-zero mean but no deterministic trend. It’s the default option and is suitable for most stationary series that fluctuate around a mean.
   - **When to use `'ct'`**: If your data shows a clear linear trend (upward or downward), use `'ct'`. This is common in economic time series that show growth or decline over time.
   - **When to use `'ctt'`**: Apply this if you believe your data shows a more complex trend (like a parabolic trend). However, it’s less commonly used.
   - **When to use `'nc'`**: If your series fluctuates around zero without a mean or trend (e.g., some financial returns series), `'nc'` might be appropriate. However, it’s rarely used.

### 3. **`autolag`**:
   - **Purpose**: Automatically selects the lag length that minimizes information criteria (e.g., AIC, BIC) to adjust for serial correlation.
   - **`autolag=None`**: Use this when you want to specify the exact `maxlag` yourself without automatic selection. This is useful when you have a specific hypothesis about the appropriate lag length or when you want consistent lag length across different tests.
   - **When to use `autolag='AIC'` (default)**: If you’re uncertain about the appropriate lag length, allowing the ADF test to choose it based on AIC is common practice. It helps in balancing the goodness of fit with model complexity.
   - **When to avoid**: Avoid `autolag` if you’re conducting a detailed analysis where you need control over the exact lag structure. Also, if you’re comparing models or series where consistency in lag length is essential, setting `autolag=None` ensures uniformity.

### **Guidelines on Applying These Options**:
- **Simpler cases (e.g., quick tests on high-frequency data)**:
  - **Use**: `maxlag=1`, `regression='c'`, `autolag=None`.
  - **Reason**: The data might not require complex lag structures or trend components, so this setup provides a straightforward test.
  
- **Longer time series with potential trends or significant autocorrelation**:
  - **Use**: `maxlag` set to an appropriate number based on data frequency, `regression='ct'` if a trend is evident, and consider keeping `autolag='AIC'` unless you have a specific lag structure in mind.
  - **Reason**: Longer series or those with trends need more careful handling to avoid biased results.

- **Detailed, controlled analysis**:
  - **Use**: Specify `maxlag`, `regression`, and `autolag=None` to maintain control over the test’s parameters.
  - **Reason**: This setup is suitable for rigorous analysis, ensuring consistency across different tests and avoiding automatic selections that may introduce variability.

Understanding the structure and characteristics of your data is key to deciding how to configure the ADF test.
